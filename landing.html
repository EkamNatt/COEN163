            <h2>Outreach</h2>
            <p>We hope to put this tool in the hands of all individuals from all age ranges. We believe in saving the planet by practicing healthy recycling habits and that starts at a young age. Another barrier that we hope to break through is the language barrier. We believe that recycling is not something bound by language. All people from different backgrounds and cultures can learn to recycle and use this app.The main component for using this app is the usage of a camera which can easily be translated to all people.</p>
